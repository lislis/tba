      ## Why isn't everybody using this?

      ---

      # !important

      There is no mainstream information

      There are no entry level guides

      The interfaces are unusable

      ## Why are we as developers not writing 'good' software?

      ---

      # ?why

      This is about awareness, responsibility and ethics.

      ---

      # > awareness

      Developers have a lot of power.

      Your code that can change people's lives,
      for the better or worse.

      Be aware that your decisions have consequences.

      ---

      # > responsibility

      We are reponsible for the actions we (don't) take and decisions we (don't) make.

      We have responsibility towards
      - user and customers
      - colleagues and co-workers
      - friends and family

      ---

      # > ethics

      How does your company make money?
      What do they do with that money?
      Would you use your own product? Would you recommend it to your parents?

      Do you implement feature that is requested without asking about its purpose?
      How far would you go to keep your integrity? Do you even care?
