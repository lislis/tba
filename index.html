      ## Why isn't everybody using this?

      ---

      # !important

      - there is no mainstream information

      - there are no entry level guides

      - the interfaces are unusable

      # ?why

      We are developers. We write software for people.

      Why is there still no good crypto?

      # ?why

      This is about awarenes, responsibility and morals.

      ---

      # > awarenes

      Being that you as developer have a lot of power.
      You write code that can change people's lives,
      for the better or worse.
      You know what consequences your decisions have.

      ---

      # > responsibility

      We are reponsible for our actions and decisions.
      We are responsible to
      - our user and customers
      - our collegues and co-workers
      - our friends and family

      ---

      # > morals

      How does your company make money?
      What do they do with that money?
      Would you use your own product? Would you recommend it to your parents?

      Do you implemery feature that is requested without asking about its purpose?
      How far would you go to keep your integrity? Do you even care?
